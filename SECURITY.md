# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently we support security patches for the two most recent minor
versions. For example, if Livebook v0.12.0 is released, we will
backport security fixes for v0.12.x and v0.11.x. Once Livebook reaches
v1.0, we plan to introduce more long-term security guarantees.
If you have any questions, please reach our to them on Discussion page.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, you can send an email to `security@livebook.dev`
or [privately disclose it on our GitHub page](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook/security).
If you don't receive an acknowledgement of the report within 24h,
feel free to ping us in our public forums (but without disclosing
the contents of the vulnerability).
