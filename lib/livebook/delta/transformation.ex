  # Implementation of the Operational Transformation algorithm for
  # deltas.
  #
  # The transformation allows for conflict resolution in concurrent
  # editing. Consider delta `Oa` and delta `Ob` that occurred at the
  # same time against the same text state `S`. The resulting new text
  # states are `S ∘ Oa` and `S ∘ Ob` respectively. Now for each text
  # state we would like to apply the other delta, so that both texts
  # converge to the same state, that is:
  #
  #     S ∘ Oa ∘ transform(Oa, Ob) = S ∘ Ob ∘ transform(Ob, Oa)
  #
  # That's the high-level idea. To actually achieve convergence we
  # have to introduce a linear order of operations. This way we can
  # resolve conflicts, for example, if two deltas insert a text at
  # the same position, we have to unambiguously determine which takes
  # precedence. A reasonable solution is to have a server process where
  # all the clients send deltas, as it naturally imposes the necessary
  # ordering.

  @doc """
  Transforms `right` delta against the `left` delta.

  Assuming both deltas represent changes applied to the same document
  state, this operation results in modified `right` delta that represents
  effectively the same changes (preserved intent), but works on the
  document with `left` delta already applied.

  The `priority` indicates which delta is considered to have happened
  first and is used for conflict resolution.
